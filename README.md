The reader registers in the system and then has the opportunity to: 
- search (by author / title); 
- place an order for a Book from the Catalog.
An unregistered reader cannot order a book. 
For the catalog to implement the ability to sort books: 
- by name; 
- by the author;
- by edition; 
- by date of issue. 
The librarian gives the reader a book by subscription or in the reading room. The book is issued to the reader 
for a certain period. If the book is not returned within the specified period, the reader will be fined. 
The book can be present in the library in one or more copies. The system maintains 
accounting for the available number of books. 
Each user has a personal account, which displays registration information, as well as 
1) for the reader: 
- list of books on the subscription and the date of possible return (if the date 
expired, the amount of the fine is displayed); 
2) for the librarian:
- list of orders of readers; 
- list of readers and their subscriptions. 
The system administrator has the rights:
- adding / deleting a book, editing information about the book;
- create / delete librarian; 
- user lock / unlock.
